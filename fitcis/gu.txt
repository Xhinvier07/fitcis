[ GUIDANCE UNIT ]

The Guidance Unit (GU) serves as the students' partner in achieving success 
in their academic, career, and personal/social domains. It is a place where any 
student can go to and talk about concerns that affect his/her life as a college 
student and as an individual. Problems or issues discussed in individual 
sessions with any of the counselors are treated with confidentiality and 
do not appear in the students' academic records.
