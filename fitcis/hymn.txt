              [ FEU HYMN ]

          Far Eastern, onward
          Beloved Alma Mater!

          Onward, oh lead us,
      The Green and Gold in view

          In thy happy halls,
     Our young heart saw the light;

     Command thy sons and daughters
        To battle for the right.

 Though far from home our feet may roam,
       Our love will still be true.

         Our voices shall unite
        To praise thy name anew.

    We'll treasure within our heart
               The FEU!

    We'll treasure within our heart
               The FEU!
