[ MECHANICAL ENGINEERING ]

The field of mechanical engineering covers two broad areas: the thermal system and the mechanical system. 
The traditional courses in mechanical engineering that include power plant engineering, industrial plant engineering 
and machine design are supplemented by new and emerging fields such as renewable energy systems, 
mechatronics, control system and computer applications. The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering program 
has the following distinctive features: elective courses in the new and emerging technologies; industry immersion 
or on-the-job training; research project; and a culminating design project. 
The program also offers new courses such as technopreneurship, design thinking and bio-engineering.
