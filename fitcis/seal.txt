[ THE INSTITUTE SEAL ]

The outer ellipse is consistent with the seal 
of all the other schools in the FEU Group. 

The images in the inner ellipse are the 
four components that symbolize what the Institute represents: 
a book, a whirlwind, a gear, and a tongue of digital fire. 

The book (or the muse) serves as the base of the structure 
and is also the source of knowledge and inspiration. 
From the pages of the book, a mighty whirlwind forms and 
boldly spins outward to spread knowledge in all directions.
It then ascends towards the highest of heavens to feed the 
fire of passion for invention in engineering- the gear; and 
information technology- the pixelated tongue of fire.
