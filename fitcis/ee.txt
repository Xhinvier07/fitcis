[ ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING ]

The field of Electrical Engineering deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electricity. 
It covers topics such as industrial and power electronics, electrical and instrumentation design and construction, machine control 
and automation, operations and maintenance of facilities, power systems operation, economics and protection, industrial 
and power plant engineering. Electrical Engineering students of FEU Institute of Technology are expected to learn and to 
experience cutting-edge design software in electrical and power systems design. They will also experience hands-on building design, 
wiring and installation, motor control design and wiring. 
With knowledge of electronics, they are expected to excel in the fields of instrumentation, automation and controls design.
