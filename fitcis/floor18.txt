[ ROOFTOP/SKYDECK ]
The rooftop on the 18th level of FEU Tech is where students can relax and breathe 
in the Manila air, while simultaneously taking in the city's most beautiful skyline vista. 
Viewing the city while lounging on the rooftop might provide the students with a much-needed moment of tranquility.
