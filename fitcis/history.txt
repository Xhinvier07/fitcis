                         [ HISTORY ]

The beginnings of the FEU Tech Library can be traced back to year 1993 
when it was still called EAST ASIA INSTITUTE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. 

The college started with initial holding of 386 volumes.
With the merging of the College of Engineering 
and the College of Information Technology in 2003,
there was a need for a tremendous increase of books for 
engineering, technology and other reading materials.

At present with its fast growing population, books and digital resources 
go hand in hand in providing the fastest information to the right users 
at the right time to ensure a constant commitment 
to the organization goals of the college.
