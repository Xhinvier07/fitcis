[ COMPUTER ENGINEERING ]

The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE) is a program that embodies the science and technology 
of design, development, implementation, maintenance, and integration of software and hardware components 
in modern computing systems and computer-controlled equipment. This program will produce computer engineers 
who are versatile and knowledgeable in computer science and electrical engineering, as well as in 
the foundations of mathematics and sciences. Also, computer engineers are expected to be life-long 
learners to maintain their knowledge and skills within their chosen discipline.
